Yammy is a work in progress mod manager for pokemon super mystery dungeon, based on the small experience I have with the OpenMW construction set (should be extremely similar to the Morrowind one's).

It use a modular core that may allow to use it with other game.

name:
yammy is a mix of the english word yummy, and yamm: Yet Another Mod Manager (cause I already wrote two similar mod manager).

# The crates:
## general
- yammy_core: the core logic of how to manage mod
- yammy_gui: the core logic for gui
## gui
- yammy_gui_cmd: a crate to modify games with a simple command line interface. Mainly for testing purpose.
